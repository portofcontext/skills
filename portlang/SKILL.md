# portlang Skill

## Core Concept

portlang treats agent behavior as **search through a conditioned space**. You don't script loops—you declare the search space:
- **Boundaries:** What the agent cannot do (enforced by sandbox)
- **Verifiers:** What success looks like (deterministic pass/fail signals, not walls of output)
- **Context budget:** Hard token ceiling
- **Environment:** What the agent can observe

The runtime executes the search. Every run produces a **trajectory** (complete event log).

**The instruction budget problem:** Models follow roughly 150–200 instructions reliably. A large system prompt, many tool definitions, growing conversation history, and re-observations all compete for that budget. portlang keeps budget usage low by design: each field is scoped narrowly, context is bounded by a hard ceiling, and re-observations inject only current state rather than accumulating history.

## Prerequisites

portlang currently only runs on apple devices.
Before running portlang fields:

1. **Install portlang:**
```bash
brew tap portofcontext/homebrew-tap
brew install portlang
```

2. **Set API key** (choose one):
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```

3. **Verify installation:**
```bash
portlang init  # Check container support
```

4. **Install the VS Code extension** (recommended): Search for **"portlang"** in the VS Code extension marketplace and install it. Provides LSP support — syntax highlighting, validation, and autocompletion for `.field` files.

**Model naming by provider:**
- Anthropic API: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`, `anthropic/claude-opus-4.5`
- OpenRouter: `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`, `anthropic/claude-3-opus`, anything on openrouter that support tool calling
- Provider auto-detected from API key

## Field File Structure

Fields use the `.field` extension (preferred) or `.toml` — both are supported. All sections are optional unless marked (required). Fields marked `"inherit"` pull their value from a parent field one directory up (auto-detected from `../*.field`).

```toml
name = "my-task"        # (required) identifier, used in trajectory storage
description = "..."     # human-readable summary

[vars]                  # optional; declare {{ var_name }} template variables
# customer_id = { required = true, description = "Salesforce account ID" }
# region = { required = false, default = "us-east-1", description = "AWS region" }

[model]                 # (required), or: model = "inherit"

[prompt]                # (required)
goal = "..."            # (required) initial task; supports {{ var }} templates
system = "..."          # optional system prompt; supports {{ var }} templates
re_observation = ["echo '=== workspace ===' && ls -1", ...]  # refresh context each step

[environment]           # optional; all fields have defaults
root = "./workspace"    # working dir (maps to /workspace in container)
packages = ["nodejs"]   # apt packages to install; list "uv" to get uv/pip
dockerfile = "./Dockerfile"  # custom Dockerfile (overrides packages)
image = "custom:tag"    # pre-built image (overrides dockerfile)

[boundary]              # optional, or: boundary = "inherit"
allow_write = ["*.py"]  # glob patterns for writable paths; default: none
network = "deny"        # "deny" | "allow"; default: allow
max_tokens = 150000     # hard ceiling on total context tokens
max_cost = "$2.00"      # hard ceiling on total cost (must be quoted string with $)
max_steps = 30          # hard ceiling on agent steps
bash = true             # enable built-in bash tool; default: true
output_schema = """{ ... }"""  # optional; JSON schema string for structured output

tools = "inherit"       # optional; inherit [[tool]] list from parent instead of defining inline

[[skill]]               # repeatable; load a Claude Code skill into the agent's context
slug = "skill-name"     # (required) skill slug identifier

[[tool]]                # repeatable; type = "python" | "shell" | "mcp"; bash/glob/write are built-in defaults

# Shell verifier (default when type is omitted):
[[verifier]]
type = "shell"          # default; type can be omitted for shell verifiers
name = "..."            # (required)
command = "..."         # shell command; exit 0 = pass, nonzero = fail; supports {{ var }} templates
trigger = "on_stop"     # "on_stop" | "always" | "on_tool:<tool_name>"; default: on_stop
description = "..."     # injected into context on failure
eval_only = false       # if true, skipped during `portlang run`; only runs during `portlang eval run`

# Levenshtein verifier (normalized edit distance):
[[verifier]]
type = "levenshtein"
name = "..."
file = "output.txt"     # optional; omit to use output_schema structured output
expected = "..."        # reference string; supports {{ var }} templates
threshold = 0.9         # similarity [0.0–1.0] required to pass; default: 1.0

# Semantic similarity verifier (cosine via embeddings):
[[verifier]]
type = "semantic"
name = "..."
file = "output.txt"     # optional; omit to use output_schema structured output
expected = "..."        # reference string to embed and compare; supports {{ var }} templates
threshold = 0.85        # cosine similarity [0.0–1.0]; default: 0.8
embedding_model = "bge-small-en-v1.5"  # local model (~67 MB, downloaded once)
# embedding_url = "https://..."  # use OpenAI-compatible endpoint instead

# Tool call verifier (inspect or require a specific tool call):
[[verifier]]
type = "tool_call"
name = "..."
tool = "bash"           # (required for on_stop) assert this tool was called
field = "/input/path"   # optional; JSON pointer into {input: {...}, output: "..."}
matches = "^[a-z]+"    # optional; regex the field value must match
not_matches = "^/etc"  # optional; regex the field value must NOT match
```

## Minimal Field File

```toml
name = "my-task"

[model]
name = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6"

[prompt]
goal = "Create hello.py that prints 'Hello, World!'"

[environment]
root = "./workspace"

[boundary]
allow_write = ["hello.py"]
max_tokens = 80000
max_cost = "$1.00"
max_steps = 10

[[verifier]]
name = "works"
command = "python hello.py 2>&1 | grep -q 'Hello, World!'"
trigger = "on_stop"
description = "Must print 'Hello, World!'"
```

## Essential Commands

## Key Patterns

### 1. Field Inheritance (shared model/boundary/tools across a suite)

If a `*.field` file exists one directory up, a child field can inherit from it automatically:

```toml
# parent/parent.field — shared config for all child fields
name = "parent"

[model]
name = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6"
temperature = 0.5

[boundary]
network = "deny"
max_tokens = 100000
max_cost = "$1.00"
max_steps = 20

[[tool]]
type = "python"
file = "./tools/shared_utils.py"
```

```toml
# parent/task-a/task.field — child; inherits from ../parent.field
name = "task-a"
model = "inherit"
boundary = "inherit"
tools = "inherit"

[prompt]
goal = "Do task A using the shared tools."
```

Inheritance eliminates duplication across eval suites. Override any section by defining it inline.

### 2. Template Variables (parameterize a field for reuse)

Declare variables in `[vars]`, use `{{ name }}` anywhere in goal/system/re_observation/verifier commands, supply at runtime with `--var`:

```toml
[vars]
currency = { required = false, default = "usd", description = "Currency to report" }

[prompt]
goal = "Get the account balance and return amounts in {{ currency }}."

[[verifier]]
name = "correct-currency"
type = "tool_call"
tool = "bash"
trigger = "on_stop"
description = "Agent must have run bash"
```

```bash
portlang run task.field --var currency=gbp
portlang run task.field --vars params.json   # bulk vars from file
portlang run task.field --input ./data.csv   # stage input file into workspace
```

`--input` with a file copies it to the workspace root. `--input '{"key":"val"}'` writes `portlang_input.json`. Use `re_observation` to surface the file contents to the agent each step.

### 3. Structured Output (agent produces validated JSON)

Define `output_schema` inside `[boundary]` as a JSON string. Schema validation is automatic — no separate verifier needed:

```toml
[boundary]
allow_write = ["output.json"]
output_schema = '''
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["status", "count"],
  "properties": {
    "status": {"type": "string", "enum": ["success", "failure"]},
    "count": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 0}
  }
}
'''
```

portlang validates the output against the schema, writes `output.json` to `/workspace`, and reports schema violations as failures. Add `[[verifier]]` entries only for additional business logic checks beyond schema conformance. Typed verifiers (`levenshtein`, `semantic`) can omit `file` to validate against the structured output directly.

### 4. Multi-Layer Verifiers (fail fast with precise feedback)

Layer verifiers from coarse to fine — each one assumes the previous passed:

```toml
[[verifier]]
name = "compiled"
command = "python script.py 2>/dev/null"
trigger = "on_stop"
description = "script.py must run without errors"

[[verifier]]
name = "correct-output"
type = "levenshtein"
file = "output.txt"
expected = "42"
threshold = 1.0
trigger = "on_stop"
description = "output.txt must contain exactly '42'"
```

Verifiers run in order, stop on first failure. Use `output_schema` instead of json verifiers when the agent produces structured JSON output.

### 5. Smart Verifier Types

**Prefer typed verifiers.** They run in the portlang runtime — no packages required, no container dependencies. Fall back to shell verifiers only for logic that can't be expressed with a typed verifier, and only use tools guaranteed in the container baseline (see section 8).

**Trigger modes:** `on_stop` (default) runs after the agent finishes. `always` runs after every step. `on_tool:<tool_name>` runs after each call to a specific tool — useful for incremental checks, e.g. `trigger = "on_tool:write"` to validate files as they're written.

**eval_only:** Set `eval_only = true` to exclude a verifier from regular `portlang run` but include it in `portlang eval run`. Use this for ground-truth comparisons (`levenshtein`, `semantic`) where the expected value is known but shouldn't affect development runs or steer agent behavior.

```toml
# Fuzzy text match (tolerates minor differences)
[[verifier]]
type = "levenshtein"
name = "close-enough"
file = "output.txt"
expected = "The answer is 42."
threshold = 0.9
trigger = "on_stop"
description = "Output must be at least 90% similar to expected"

# Semantic match (meaning, not exact text)
[[verifier]]
type = "semantic"
name = "right-idea"
file = "summary.txt"
expected = "The model achieved high accuracy on the test set."
threshold = 0.85
trigger = "on_stop"
description = "Summary must convey the correct conclusion"
```

Local embedding model downloaded automatically (~67 MB, no API key required).

### 6. Scoped Boundaries

```toml
[boundary]
allow_write = ["output.json", "logs/*.txt"]
network = "deny"
max_tokens = 100000
max_cost = "$1.00"
max_steps = 20
```

### 7. Re-observation (prevent context rot)

```toml
[prompt]
goal = "..."
re_observation = [
  "echo '=== workspace ===' && ls -1 *.py *.txt 2>/dev/null | cat",
  "echo '=== tests ===' && python -m pytest --tb=no -q 2>&1 | tail -5",
]
```

Commands run before each agent step, injecting fresh state without accumulating history. This is the principled alternative to the Ralph loop — instead of periodically restarting the session to clear context rot, you push only what the agent needs to know right now. The context window stays bounded; the agent always knows current state.

### 8. Custom Environment

```toml
[environment]
root = "./workspace"
packages = ["nodejs", "npm"]    # Install apt packages

# Or use a custom Dockerfile:
dockerfile = "./Dockerfile"

# Or a pre-built image:
image = "myregistry/myimage:latest"
```

**Default container baseline:** The container is minimal. Available by default: standard POSIX shell builtins, `bash`, `curl`, `wc`, `grep`, `cat`, `ls`, `find`. **Not available** unless added to `packages` or a custom image: `python3`, `node`, `jq`, `git`, and most other tools.

Shell verifiers run inside the container and are subject to the same constraints. **Prefer typed verifiers** (`type = "json"`, `"levenshtein"`, `"semantic"`) over shell verifiers whenever possible — they run natively in the portlang runtime and require nothing installed. Only use shell verifiers for checks that require container-side execution, and only invoke tools you've declared in `packages`.

### 9. Custom Tools

**Default tools (always available, no `[[tool]]` entry needed):**
- `bash` — run shell commands in the container
- `glob` — find files by pattern
- `write` — write files to allowed paths

Define `[[tool]]` entries only to add capabilities beyond these three.

**Python tools are the default choice.** Use shell tools only for trivial single-command wrappers (e.g. `wc`, `cp`). Anything that parses output, handles errors, calls an API, or processes data belongs in a Python tool.

portlang auto-extracts everything the agent uses from the Python function — **the quality of these annotations directly determines how well the agent uses the tool:**

| Python source | Agent sees |
|---|---|
| Function name | Tool name |
| Docstring | Tool description (how agent decides when to call it) |
| Parameter type hints | Input schema (validated before call) |
| `Literal["a", "b"]` | Enum constraints |
| Pydantic `BaseModel` return | Output schema (agent knows exactly what it gets back) |

Use `-> dict` and the agent gets no output schema. Use `-> MyModel(BaseModel)` and the agent sees typed fields it can reason about.

**Anti-pattern — don't do this:**
```toml
# Bad: brittle, untyped, hard to debug
[[tool]]
type = "shell"
name = "fetch_data"
command = "curl -s {url} | jq '.results' > /workspace/data.json && echo '{\"ok\": true}'"
input_schema = '{"type": "object", "properties": {"url": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["url"]}'
```

**Do this instead — Python tool:**
```python
# tools/fetch_data.py
# /// script
# dependencies = ["requests", "pydantic"]
# ///

import json, pathlib
import requests
from pydantic import BaseModel

class FetchResult(BaseModel):
    ok: bool
    count: int
    output_path: str

def fetch_data(url: str, output_path: str) -> FetchResult:
    """Fetch JSON from a URL and write results to output_path."""
    resp = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
    resp.raise_for_status()
    data = resp.json().get("results", [])
    pathlib.Path(output_path).write_text(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
    return FetchResult(ok=True, count=len(data), output_path=output_path)
```

```toml
[[tool]]
type = "python"
file = "./tools/fetch_data.py"
function = "fetch_data"  # schema auto-extracted from type hints
```

> **Python tool rules:**
> - **Use Pydantic models as return types.** portlang auto-extracts the JSON schema — no manual schema needed. Raise exceptions on errors rather than returning error dicts.
> - Each tool file runs in isolation — tool files cannot import each other. Put all related logic in one file.
> - Declare third-party dependencies with a `# /// script` PEP 723 block at the top; `uv` installs them automatically — no need to add packages to `[environment]`.
> - File paths in `file =` are relative to the field file, not the workspace root.

**Shell tool (for simple wrappers only):**
```toml
[[tool]]
type = "shell"
name = "word_count"
description = "Count words in a file"
command = "wc -w {path}"
input_schema = '{"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["path"]}'
```

**Tool-first design:** Write Python tools before writing the field. The agent's goal should be: call the tool, write the output. This keeps steps under 5, cost under $0.05, and boundaries naturally minimal. Agents that try to do complex work through raw bash (curl pipes, temp files, awk scripts) burn budget and fail more often.

**MCP server (stdio):**
```toml
[[tool]]
type = "mcp"
name = "filesystem"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/workspace"]
transport = "stdio"
```

**MCP server (HTTP/SSE):**
```toml
[[tool]]
type = "mcp"
name = "stripe"
url = "https://mcp.stripe.com"
transport = "http"
headers = { Authorization = "Bearer ${STRIPE_KEY}" }
```

### 10. Agent Skills

Load Claude Code skills into the agent's context using `[[skill]]` entries. Skills inject specialized knowledge or instructions into the agent before it starts.

```toml
[[skill]]
slug = "rust-best-practices"

[[skill]]
slug = "portlang"
```

Skills are loaded in declaration order. Use `--runner claude-code` — skills are passed via `npx skills inject` and are available as system prompt context during the run.

### 11. Claude Code Runner

Use `--runner claude-code` to run the agent loop through Claude Code instead of the native runner. This gives the agent Edit, Glob, Grep, LSP, WebSearch, and WebFetch — the full Claude Code toolset — inside portlang's sandbox and verifier system.

```bash
portlang run example.field --runner claude-code
```

**Auth:** if Claude Code is already installed and authenticated, no setup is needed — portlang reads credentials from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` automatically. Otherwise run `claude setup-token`, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

**How field config maps to Claude Code:**

| Field config | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `model.name` | Passed to Claude Code |
| `[[tool]]` MCP | Passed directly via `--mcp-config` |
| `[[tool]]` shell/python | Wrapped as MCP stdio servers, run in container |
| `boundary.allow_write` | Enforced via PostToolUse hook on Write/Edit |
| `boundary.max_steps/cost/tokens` | Monitored from stream; process killed on breach |
| `[[verifier]]` shell, `on_stop` | Run by portlang after agent exits |
| `[[verifier]]` shell, `always`/`on_tool` | Run as Claude Code PostToolUse hooks |
| `boundary.network` | Always enabled (Claude Code requires API access) |
| `boundary.output_schema` | Agent receives a `submit_output` tool; structured output captured from tool call |

**Limitations vs native runner:** `tool_call` verifiers and boundary context tracing are not supported.

### 12. Batch Evaluation

```bash
portlang eval run ./examples/
portlang eval view ./examples/   # Open interactive HTML dashboard
```

Useful for regression testing after changes.

## Debugging Workflow

1. **Run fails** → `portlang view trajectory <id> --format text` to replay step-by-step
2. **Find failure point** → Check which verifier failed and at which step
3. **Non-determinism** → `portlang view diff <id-a> <id-b>` to find divergence
4. **Visual debugging** → `portlang view trajectory <id>` for HTML view
5. **Optimize** → `portlang run task.field -n 10` to measure reliability
6. **Patterns** → `portlang view field <field-name>` for adaptation analysis
7. **Insights** → `portlang reflect --field <field-name>` to surface AI-powered insights from trajectories

## Common Issues

**Budget exhausted:**
- Start conservative: `max_cost = "$0.25"` for simple tasks, `$1.00` for network-heavy tasks; increase after profiling
- Increase `max_tokens` or reduce `max_steps` in `[boundary]`
- Simplify `re_observation` commands — context rot (early history crowding out current state) often masquerades as budget exhaustion; inject minimal, current-state signals only
- Check for tool error loops
- Move complex logic into Python tools so the agent does orchestration, not implementation

**Low convergence rate (<70%):**
- Strengthen verifiers (make expectations explicit)
- Tighten boundaries (restrict file access)
- Clarify goal in `[prompt]`
- Lower `temperature` (e.g., `temperature = 0.0`)

**Verifier always passes/fails:**
- Weak signal (>95% or <10% pass rate) — adjust verifier command

**Structured output not valid:**
- Add an explicit `[[verifier]]` to check `output.json`
- Ensure `[prompt].goal` names the required fields explicitly
- Use `temperature = 0.0` for consistent JSON output

## Core Principles

1. **Boundaries are topology, not policy** - Make bad actions impossible, not discouraged
2. **Verifiers give deterministic signals** - Not post-hoc checks; they steer behavior by giving the agent precise feedback instead of raw output to interpret
3. **Context is finite and attention degrades** - Smaller context windows produce better results; hard ceilings are quality controls, not just cost controls
4. **Trajectories are data** - Replay, diff, analyze distributions; measure convergence rate before shipping
5. **Engineer the environment, not the prompt** - Agent policy is opaque; the environment is yours. Use actual control flow for control flow, not prompt instructions
